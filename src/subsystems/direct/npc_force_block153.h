// R153 NPC DEFENCE BY SKILL (Miki 8 Nov: "make the block or evade or parry for the NPC more often - now I could cut
// through the easier enemies like butter - not one managed to block or evade").
// R146 BY SKILL (npc_defense.h) only makes a defence the NPC has ALREADY chosen faster. If the native NPC never chooses
// one, nothing is sped up. The 8 Nov run (F4 press 1, 46 native strikes, 5 kills) had no defence at all.
// The choice itself is the game's own switch wh_cs_ForceBlock ("Force AI to block by: 0 disabled, 1 normal block,
// 2 perfect block, ..."), the C39 lever. With BY SKILL ON (or VrDirectNpcBlock 1..3) one roll is made for Henry's NEXT
// swing against his current opponent (exact reciprocal C_CombatActor pair, as C39/H24 read it):
//   chance = 40 % (R177; R153: 25 %) at the opponent's best melee skill 0 .. 75 % at skill >= 30 (VrDirectNpcBlock 1: R177 50 .. 85 %, 2/3: always).
// A won roll leases wh_cs_ForceBlock = 1 (mode 3: 2) during that swing only (R156: wind-up + strike, never between swings),
// then it is rolled again. A lost roll
// leaves the native value. The lease is written BEFORE the swing starts, so the native block offer of that swing sees it.
// The native block itself (animation, raise speed from R146, direction, result, Henry's own block) is unchanged.
// Off F4 combat / no reciprocal opponent / stale data: the original value is put back. No latch, every tick re-decides.
// R156 (Miki 8 Nov, R155 build: the prologue sparring with Capon - "hit him 4 times" with the wooden sword - never ended):
// the opponent of a scripted sparring / lesson is not an enemy, and "Force AI to block" must never be put on him. The mod
// cannot read faction hostility (no such read exists in the mod), so the gate is Henry's own weapon: a practice / quest
// copy (R136: alias definition without its own weight = the tutorial wooden sword, `V66.98 ITEM ... defSource=ALIAS_SOURCE
// weightDefault=1`) in either hand = no roll, native value kept, for ANY VrDirectNpcBlock mode and for BY SKILL alike.
// A real weapon drawn again = the roll runs again on the next tick (no latch). Published by the equipment snapshot
// (native_equipment_snapshot.inl PhysRefreshEquipment103, game thread), read by the control thread.
